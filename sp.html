    <h3>Like bees to honey, we followed the sugar trail across India, discovering recipes, imbibing traditions and mastering new skills to build our very own sweet shop.</br>
    We take familiar sweets that we love and create something entirely new.</br>
    So take a piece, a slice or whole boxes of your favourites and savour some old fashioned sweetness.</br>
    A box of our mithai is more than a sweet symphony for your tastebuds.</br> It brings back smiles, fond memories and sticky fingers that need immediate attention.</br>
    The sweet shop, is a place you come to get lost in the wonder of mithai.</br> From open mithai stations to freshly churned kulfi soft serve we’ve got it all.</br> Willy Wonka’s Indian cousin is all you need to remember and you’ll know what we’re all about.</br> Come experience it all in one of our mithai tours.</br>
    The traditional mithai has been reinvented with modern-day ingredients, flavours and techniques.</br>
